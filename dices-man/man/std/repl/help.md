`help` is the intrisic that give access to the `dices` manual. 
You can call it using a string as the single parameter, specifying the topic you are searching for. Some topics are organized in subfolders, accessed with the usual path separator `/`. For example this page is available at `std/repl/help`.
To see a complete index of the manual see `help("index")`. For an introduction to the language, `help()` or `help("introduction")`.

`help` always return `null`.
